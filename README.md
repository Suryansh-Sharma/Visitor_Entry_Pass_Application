üîê Authentication & Security

The application includes a robust authentication system with the following features:

    JWT Authentication
    Secure user login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Access tokens are issued upon successful login and used to authorize API requests.

    Refresh Token Mechanism
    Refresh tokens are issued alongside access tokens to allow silent re-authentication without forcing users to log in repeatedly. This improves UX while maintaining security.

    JWT Blacklist on Logout
    When a user logs out, their JWT is invalidated by storing it in a blacklist to prevent reuse, even if it hasn‚Äôt expired. This protects against token theft and replay attacks.

    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    Users are assigned roles (e.g., ADMIN, RECEPTIONIST), and access to API endpoints is restricted based on roles and authorities.

    Token Expiry Handling
    Access tokens have a short lifespan, and refresh tokens have a longer one. The backend handles token validation and expiry automatically.
